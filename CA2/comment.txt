marks/10: 7    Comments: building and searching the movie trees gives the right results; in your _findminnode, if there is no left child, you are searching down the right branch - but you have included the update to the spec, which says you should return the minimal element in the subtree at this node, which means that if there is no leftbranch, you should return the element of the current node (since the right branch can only have larger elements); also, you should keep findminnode() for returning the node, and then extract the element for findmin() (it is needed in remove); when removing a leaf, you overwrite the parent's left child if it exists, instead of if it is the removed node; remove() is meant to be returning the movie, but you return the BSTNode;
